mStream
=======

mStream is a small script that you can use to browse a directory for mp3 files.  jPlayer is used to stream files to wherever you are.  


SETUP
=======

There's three variables you need to edit before this will work.  Here's what you need to do:

-Open up playexplore.php
-Edit lines 19, 21, 23
-Save and enjoy

NOTE: You need to have your media in your webroot.  I used a symlink to make this easy
